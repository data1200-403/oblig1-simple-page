                    We all know that Europeans, especially those from the Nordic countries can't get along with the morning without a good cup of coffee. I'm sure Graf Zeppelin here would agree with you in that regard.

                            Seriously, who the bloody hell gave Sara a stinger? Whats next, Phalanx CIWS instead of the Oerlikons and Patriots instead of Bofors? Might as well yoink some Des Moines turrets to put on the deck and give her 8in VT for those too...

                    <h3>Midway</h3>
                        <p>The battle of Midway was often known as the turning point of the war in the Pacific, but was it really? Could the Japanese really keep up to the level of production that the US could? They were printing ships like no tomorrow. Think about this: Iowas were being printed in half a years time, escort carriers came in 6 weeks and they had more Essex class fleet carriers see combat than the Japanese had Armoured Fleet Carriers, Fleet Carriers, Light Carriers, Escort Carriers and Amphibious Assault Ships total. Then consider there were over 100 US Escort Carriers, many other fleet and light carriers on top of having the transport capacity to keep the fleet going...</p>

                        <p>
                            There are stories from the pacific where US Marines would refuse to attack fortified Japanese islands if there was no presence of LCT(R)s available for final point suppression once the Marines hit shore. The Japanese were aware of this, and would sometimes not man beach positions and instead let the US Marines get further into the island before engaging, negating the ability of the US to provide accurate rocket artillery support.
