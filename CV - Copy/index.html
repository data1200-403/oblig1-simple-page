    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Bearing the name of both a very unlucky underaged bote and a very brave...perhaps too brave one, both who sacrificed their lives for the Allied war effort. Though probably more based off the former than the latter. I'm a hard working and very caring for my friends. I have never let down those around me and always fought to the bitter end. May the cold waters take me over my friends.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Basic USN Training clearly doesn't pay off. I'm sure Ernest Joseph King, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet would agree. Couldn't even hit the biggest, slowest target moving in a straight line in the most favourable of conditions!

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>Worked as a Torpedo Boat Destroyer in the US Navy during the War, being commissioned the 6th of July 1943, the year before D-Day. One of my earliest missions in the Atlantic shortly after basic training with my crew was a highly secretive mission. The mission was to escort the BB-61 USS Iowa carrying the Presiden of the United States of America, Franklin D. Roosevelt across the pond to the Tehran Conference. Along the way, we practiced anti-aircraft and torpedo launch drills after having maybe depth-charged some fish by accident.
    </p>

    <p>Having been transferred to the Aleutian Islands for a few months, I later served in the Pacific where my career ended with the destruction of an Aichi D3A "Val" dive bomber I had shot down maintaining its momentum and somehow getting underneath my keel, exploding like a modern keel-breaker torpedo on the 10th of June 1945... Despite dauntless efforts, my fate was sealed. My commitment to my friends meant they all survived the ordeal. I hope they will remember me as the good girl I was...
