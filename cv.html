        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Bearing the name of both a very unlucky underaged bote and a very brave...perhaps too brave one, both who
            sacrificed their lives for the Allied war effort. Though probably more based off the former than the latter.
            I'm a hard working and very caring for my friends. I have never let down those around me and always fought
            to the bitter end. May the cold waters take me over my friends.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Basic USN Training clearly doesn't pay off. I'm sure Ernest Joseph King, Commander in Chief, United States
            Fleet would agree. Couldn't even hit the biggest, slowest target moving in a straight line in the most
            favourable of conditions!
        <ul class="blue">
            <li>Commissioned into the US Navy on the 6th July 1943</li>
            <li>Completed 5 weeks of battle practice with CV-11 USS Intrepid and parts of the US Atlantic Fleet</li>
            <li>Performed anti-aircraft drills with BB-61 USS Iowa on the 14th November 1943</li>
            <li>Performed torpedo drills with BB-61 USS Iowa on the 14th November 1943</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>Worked as a Torpedo Boat Destroyer in the US Navy during the War, being commissioned the 6th of July 1943,
            the year before D-Day. One of my earliest missions in the Atlantic shortly after basic training with my crew
            was a highly secretive mission. The mission was to escort the BB-61 USS Iowa carrying the Presiden of the
            United States of America, Franklin D. Roosevelt across the pond to the Tehran Conference. Along the way, we
            practiced anti-aircraft and torpedo launch drills after having maybe depth-charged some fish by accident.
        </p>
        <p>Having been transferred to the Aleutian Islands for a few months, I later served in the Pacific where my
            career ended with the destruction of an Aichi D3A "Val" dive bomber I had shot down maintaining its momentum
            and somehow getting underneath my keel, exploding like a modern keel-breaker torpedo on the 10th of June
            1945... Despite dauntless efforts, my fate was sealed. My commitment to my friends meant they all survived
            the ordeal. I hope they will remember me as the good girl I was...
